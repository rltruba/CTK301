Eat half my food and ask for more gnaw the corn cob so please let me outside pouty face yay! wait, it's cold out please let me inside pouty face oh, thank you rub against mommy's leg oh it looks so nice out, please let me outside again the neighbor cat was mean to me please let me back inside for lick butt and make a weird face yet spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce but poop in the plant pot. Wake up human for food at 4am make meme, make cute face.
